<h2>What is this website?</h2>

<br>
<p>This website is a practice environment for me to start working with basic web development and figuring out how to code a little bit.
I have put togethter a few pages of reciepes that I will be adding to when I get the chance so that this serves two purposes. One, I get to have a nice
centralized place to keep all my favorite recipes. And two, I get to slowly figure out how to put together and operate a personal website. Hopefully soon 
I can get a little server going for this and actually send this out to the homies so we can all bake together!
